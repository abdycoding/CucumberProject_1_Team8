# TECHNOSTUDY Agile Software Testing Project - ParaSoft/Parabank TR Sprint

## Project Overview
The ParaSoft/Parabank TR Sprint is a one-week sprint focused on automating functional tests for Parabank, a virtual banking application used to simulate and test financial operations. While it is not a real financial institution, it serves as a reliable tool for software testing, simulating banking functionalities such as account creation, money transfers, loan applications, and bill payments.

For this sprint, we will be using the following test environment:
- [Parabank Test Environment URL](https://parabank.parasoft.com/)
- [Alternative URL](https://para.testar.org/)

## User Stories
The following user stories will guide our sprint tasks:
- **US601 | User Registration**: Automate the registration process for new users in ParaBank.
- **US602 | User Login**: Verify the login functionality for registered users.
- **US603 | Bill Payment Functionality**: Test the payment process for various bills such as electricity, water, and gas.
- **US604 | Account Creation**: Automate the creation of checking and savings accounts.
- **US606 | Inter-Account Money Transfer**: Test the ability to transfer money between the user’s own accounts.
- **US607 | Contact Information Update**: Verify the process of updating contact information.
- **US608 | Loan Application**: Test the loan application process and its outcomes.

## Project Objectives
- **Enhancing Functional Test Automation**: The primary goal is to automate functional UI tests, verifying the functionality of the Parabank web application through automated scenarios.
- **Sprint Mode**: As with previous sprints, the aim is to complete specific functional tests within a set timeframe and achieve automation for certain parts of the application.
- **Tools and Technologies**: We will use tools like Jira, Xray, GitHub, Java, Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, and Maven to manage and automate functional tests effectively.
- **Skill Development**: Participants will improve their technical skills with the mentioned tools and technologies, along with soft skills such as teamwork, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving.
- **Verification and Documentation**: At the end of the sprint, the team leader will share the project’s GitHub link in the #projects channel on Discord to document progress transparently.
- **Iterative Improvements**: We aim for continuous improvements in test automation and functional testing based on feedback from each iteration.
- **Improving User Experience (UX)**: Functional tests also aim to identify and fix issues that may impact user experience.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Test Automation Tools**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Test Framework**: TestNG
- **BDD Framework**: Cucumber
- **Test Automation Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM)
- **Dependency Management and Build**: Maven
- **Reporting Tools**: Extent Reports (or a similar reporting tool)
- **Version Control System**: Git and GitHub
- **Test Management Tools**: JIRA & XRAY (or similar tools)
- **Logging Interface**: SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

## Project Phases and Tasks
Following our familiar sprint approach:
1. **Scenario Design**: We will use the Page Object Model and implement logging with `log4j-core`. Scenarios will be user-focused, utilizing "Scenario Outlines" and "Data Tables" to cover different cases.
2. **Test Automation**: Using Java and Selenium, scenarios will be converted into automated scripts organized with TestNG. Cucumber’s Gherkin syntax will make scenarios understandable even to stakeholders without coding knowledge.
3. **Runner Class Utilization**: Cucumber runner classes will be employed for automatic execution, managed through TestNG XML files.
4. **Process Management**: Tasks will be managed on Jira/XRAY and GitHub, following Scrum principles. Updates and fixes will be applied iteratively as new knowledge is gained.
5. **Bug Tracking**: Detected issues will be logged, tracked, and resolved in collaboration with the development team.
6. **Readme Documentation**: A comprehensive README file (this document) will be added to the root directory on GitHub, covering project details, technologies used, the working environment, and team members.
